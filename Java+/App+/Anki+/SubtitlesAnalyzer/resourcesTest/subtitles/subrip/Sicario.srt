1
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,121
Get down! Get down!

2
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,321
Don't move!

3
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,686
FBI! Don't move!

4
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,561
Get down! Get down!

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
Where are the hostages?
Where are the hostages?

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,888
- FBI, Police! Don't move!
- Down! Stay down!

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,566
Cross your legs! Cross your legs
and put your hands in the air!

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,125
Police! Don't move! Police! Don't move!
Get down! Get down!

9
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,888
- Clear!
- Police! Search warrant. Don't move!

10
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,925
- Steppin' out!
- Police, don't move!

11
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,049
Police, don't move! Search warrant!

12
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,246
FBI!

13
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,287
Are you hit?

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,447
I'm good.

15
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,007
Fuck!

16
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,445
Front, you're clear!

17
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,451
Team leader! Status?

18
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,085
- Front clear!
- We're clear, ma'am!

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,845
Two suspects in custody!

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,605
- You okay, Macer?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,047
Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,966
Whoa...

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,564
What the fuck?

24
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,366
Jesus!

25
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,090
Those weren't our hostages.

26
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,521
No. That was somethin' else.

27
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,561
- Mace r?
-Yeah?

28
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,927
U.S. Attorney wants a statement.
What do you want me to say to her?

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,081
The truth.

30
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,170
Looks like Sonora.

31
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,407
Yeah.

32
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,801
How many, total?

33
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,002
We've got 15 in this hall here,
about 20 in the back bedroom.

34
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,050
We haven't even checked the attic
or under the crawl space.

35
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,242
Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,924
This one of the houses
owned by Manuel Diaz?

37
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,641
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

38
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,601
Jesus Christ.

39
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,844
Reg, step out. It's okay.

40
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,048
Vickers! I need bolt cutters!

41
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,281
Vickers!

42
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,525
PD found something.

43
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,561
Relax.

44
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,681
Relax.

45
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,850
<i>Such a heavy body count
this close to Phoenix,</i>

46
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,562
<i>is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels.</i>

47
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>There will be pressure in Washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage</i>

48
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,008
<i>could happen so deep inside
the American heartland.</i>

49
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,601
<i>We may be talking about the victims
of a turf war,</i>

50
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,565
<i>or maybe some illegal immigrants
who are tied to a ransom,</i>

51
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,925
<i>but it will be some weeks before we have
a clearer picture on who the victims...</i>

52
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,046
What's goin' on?

53
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,727
I have no idea.

54
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,484
She's been leading
our kidnap response team for three years.

55
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,127
Put her through the grinder since
she got here, and she hasn't blinked.

56
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,765
She's in the front line.

57
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,690
Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate
to see these guys go down.

58
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,564
So, she's a thumper.

59
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,881
Today was her fifth O.l.S.

60
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,203
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie.
She never worked cases?

61
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,368
Been kicking doors since day one.

62
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,529
I like her already. What about the partner?
He seen any action?

63
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,409
He's only been with us 18 months.

64
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,891
What's his background?

65
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,045
He's a sharp kid.
ROTC scholarship to Maryland,

66
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,169
did a tour in Iraq,
got his law degree from UNC.

67
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,125
He's green, but he's good.

68
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,884
No lawyers on this train.
Just give me the girl.

69
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
We did this by the book, right?

70
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,806
Come on, of course.

71
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,051
- Jesus.
- What?

72
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh, shit.

73
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,761
Would you step in here, Kate?

74
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,641
Quite a find today,
the loss of two officers notwithstanding.

75
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,081
Yes, sir.

76
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,530
How familiar are you
with Manuel Diaz's operation?

77
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,641
His company, Sun Oasis,
has 80 or so foreclosure properties.

78
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,082
He has other legitimate businesses.

79
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,649
But he's rumored to be linked
with one of the Mexican cartels.

80
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,971
Manuel Diaz works for the Sonora Cartel.

81
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,561
He's most likely their senior member
in the United States.

82
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,689
What do you know about his brother?

83
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,730
I wasn't aware he had one.

84
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,850
Guillermo. His brother's name is Guillermo.

85
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,291
Do you know anything about his cousin?

86
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,647
I didn't know he had one of those either.
None of that is in his file.

87
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,609
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

88
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,205
I don't know who that is.

89
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,089
No one does. He's off the grid.

90
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,083
He's number three in the Sonora Cartel.

91
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,490
This is not my department, sir.

92
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,171
Like I said,
Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.

93
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,442
She runs a kidnap response team.

94
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,881
Are you married?

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
Am I married?

96
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,370
Do you have a husband?

97
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,921
Divorced.

98
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,327
Kids?

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,681
No.

100
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,841
Anything else?

101
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,450
No. Thanks, Kate.
If you could wait outside, please.

102
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,485
- Well?
- I have no clue.

103
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,249
Who are those people? You know?

104
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,447
No idea.

105
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,765
Thanks for coming in, guys.

106
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,010
Will you come back in, Kate?

107
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,766
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels
involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.

108
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,800
This is Matt Graver.
He'll be leading the team.

109
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,881
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?

110
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,368
No, we're expanding
the scope of the investigation a bit.

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,365
You'll act as a liaison.

112
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,487
What does that mean?

113
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,127
They need an agent
with tactical experience, like you.

114
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,487
State Department
is pulling an agent from the field

115
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,723
that specializes in responding
to escalated cartel activity.

116
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,202
You'll be part of the team.

117
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,085
You'll meet up with them at Luke tomorrow?

118
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,406
Day after. Early.

119
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,481
Air Force Base?

120
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.

121
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,326
Diaz's brother?

122
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,811
That's the one.

123
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,441
Where is he?

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,923
He's in the El Paso area.

125
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
What's our objective?

126
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,969
To dramatically overreact.

127
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,329
Kate, you must volunteer
for an inter-agency task force.

128
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,928
Think very hard before you respond.

129
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,850
You wanna be a part of this?

130
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,163
Do we get an opportunity
at the men responsible for today?

131
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,526
The men who were really responsible
for today, yeah.

132
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,245
I'll volunteer.

133
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,840
Papa!

134
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,561
<i>Si.</i>

135
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,527
No.

136
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,611
You keep an eye on that doughy prick
with the flip-flops.

137
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,681
Don't trust him.

138
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,006
How you doin', sir?

139
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
L.D.'s?

140
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,008
She's on the list, but you're not.

141
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,127
Well, what's she supposed to do?

142
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,486
I need you to turn this around for me.

143
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,931
It's fine. It's good.

144
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll call you when we're headed back.

145
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,521
All right.

146
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,764
- Morning.
- Morning. Am I late?

147
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,286
No, no, no. Wejust landed.
Come on, this way.

148
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,611
My bird dog over there, Alejandro.

149
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,847
We're taking this?

150
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,082
Yeah. Only the best for you.

151
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,331
DOD flies you around in private jets now?

152
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,970
Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?

153
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,246
Right.

154
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,969
Is there any food on this flight?

155
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,642
Some bitchin' peanuts in the back.
But it's kind of a self-serve deal.

156
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,000
<i>Kate Maser.</i>

157
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,605
<i>Have you been to Juarez before'?</i>

158
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,883
No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?

159
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,163
Yeah, amazing. Okay.

160
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,681
Are you okay?

161
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,609
Yeah. I'm fine.

162
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,286
So...

163
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,884
So, this is your specialty?

164
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,171
The cartels in Mexico are your specialty?

165
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,442
Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,611
Is there anything I should know?

167
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,841
You're asking me how a watch works.

168
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,522
For now, just keep an eye on the time.

169
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,881
Okay.

170
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,167
How you doin'?

171
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,004
Howdy! How you been?

172
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,168
Good, buddy. How you feelin'?

173
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,761
Well, when I pee, it burns.

174
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,045
Maybe it's gonorrhea.

175
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,091
What color is it?

176
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,164
Yellow with red specks.

177
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,091
Red specks or blood?

178
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,723
I'm tryin' to get DOD to let me look into this
conspiracy to sink Fiji.

179
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
- Fiji?
- Yeah.

180
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,690
Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!

181
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,089
Exactly. I figure a month or two over there,
we'll get it all worked out.

182
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,125
So, who's goin' over there today?

183
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,481
Marshals, DEA...
I pulled a team for you, Matt.

184
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,006
Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team."
it makes me all warm and fuzzy.

185
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,562
They're a crack bunch, too.
Just rotated back from Afghanistan.

186
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,529
Where's everybody linkin' up?

187
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,451
A.l.C.

188
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,804
Good, good, good.

189
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,770
Mexican Federal Police
will meet you at the border,

190
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,650
and proceed with you to the courthouse,
located here.

191
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,484
This is a high-level target.

192
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,810
The most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange,

193
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,406
and at the border crossing on the return.

194
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,925
The Marshals will enter...

195
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,443
Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?

196
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,561
Now, the Marshals' response team
is in Laredo...

197
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,721
Love Texans.

198
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,761
...so our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along,

199
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,531
and will escort the Marshals
on the exchange.

200
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,924
And here's the man of the hour.

201
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,931
You comin' with or waitin' here?

202
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,646
We'll take the tour with you.
Loan us a couple pop guns.

203
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,848
All right, this is turnin' into an all-star affair!

204
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,604
Keith, you want another hand
on the exchange?

205
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,801
You sober?

206
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,204
Will be by the time we get there.

207
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,681
Got a bottle in the truck
in case your hands get shaky.

208
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,450
I know I could always count on you, Keith.

209
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,404
All right, we'll gear you up
as soon as we're done here.

210
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,849
Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear,
and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.

211
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,922
Now, be careful on the turnaround.

212
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,446
If the Federale's a shooter,
it's gonna happen on the turnaround.

213
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,328
Delta's Team One will be the lead vehicle.

214
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,610
We can divide Team Two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?

215
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,364
Good. Now, Delta,
if you can identify yourselves,

216
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,364
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan.

217
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,523
The most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return.

218
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,405
Anywhere along the way, anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter.

219
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,560
The op isn't over until we get back here.

220
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,446
Okay?

221
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,284
Be alert. Be vigilant. And be aware. Let's go.

222
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,126
What?

223
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,170
Hey! I thought you were in prison.

224
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,526
They took me out.

225
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,365
They needed somebody for this job.

226
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,404
For good behavior or bad behavior?

227
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,165
Have you ever been over there?

228
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,884
I worked in Juérez.

229
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,525
For the DEA?

230
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,481
No.

231
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,121
For who?

232
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,526
For Mexico.

233
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,290
I was a prosecutor.

234
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,931
You're not American?

235
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,201
No.

236
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,691
Who do you work for now?

237
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,204
I go where I'm sent.

238
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,205
Where were you sent from?

239
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,211
Cartagena.

240
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,526
Colombia.

241
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,681
Listen...

242
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,331
Nothing will make sense
to your American ears.

243
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,608
And you will doubt everything that we do.

244
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,767
But in the end, you will understand.

245
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,528
Here, try this on. See if it fits.

246
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,968
Is he CIA? Are you?

247
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,003
He's a DOD advisor, just like me.

248
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,361
No, he's not.

249
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,284
Just pay attention to Alejandro.
If he says to do somethin', just do it.

250
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,721
I'm not authorized to follow orders
from Alejandro!

251
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,166
Especially in Mexico!

252
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,571
Fine. Then stay here.

253
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,806
But you don't want to, do you?

254
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,644
I just wanna know what I'm getting into.

255
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,209
Kate, you volunteered to get on this train
because you know

256
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,330
you're doing nothing in Phoenix.
You're just sweeping up a fucking mess.

257
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,687
In six months, every single house you raid
will be rigged with explosives.

258
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,281
Do you want to find the guys responsible?
Yes or no?

259
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,407
Yes.

260
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,641
'Yes?
'Yes!

261
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,051
This is where we start.

262
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,480
Try it on.

263
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,931
There she is.

264
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,926
The beast.

265
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,811
<i>Juarez.</i>

266
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,966
You know,

267
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,560
1900s, President Taft
went to visit President Dl'az.

268
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,208
Took 4,000 men with him.

269
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,803
And it almost was called off.

270
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,049
Some guy had a pistol.

271
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,249
Was gonna walk right up to Taft
and just blow his brains out.

272
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,563
But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!

273
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,170
Think he felt safe?

274
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,529
Welcome to Juérez.

275
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,331
It's brilliant what they do.

276
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,843
When they mutilate a body like that,

277
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,809
they make people think
they must have been involved,

278
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,929
they must have deserved such a death
'cause they did something.

279
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,004
It's brilliant what they do.

280
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,406
You hear that?

281
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,645
Those aren't firecrackers.

282
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,685
<i>Mexicans are adjusting our route.</i>

283
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,043
<i>There's activity ahead,
we need to go around. Everyone hold on.</i>

284
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,850
Nothing will happen here.

285
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,930
They try anything, it will be at the border.

286
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,367
Keep an eye out for the State Police.

287
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,522
They're not always the good guys.

288
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,564
Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!

289
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,325
<i>Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.</i>

290
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,450
I'm gettin' a boner.

291
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,726
<i>Is that one of ours?</i>

292
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,605
Watch the right, watch the right.

293
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,491
<i>No, that's</i> a <i>lone</i> wolf.

294
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,011
<i>Eyes on rooftops.</i>

295
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,481
<i>Nothing.</i>

296
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,926
<i>Rooftops clear.</i>

297
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,408
<i>Bridge is one klick out. Road is secure.
Hotfoot it, gentlemen.</i>

298
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,681
<i>Everyone stay in this lane.
Our agents at the border are</i>

299
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,281
<i>waving traffic through
to get us over as quickly as they can.</i>

300
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,690
<i>Everyone stay frosty.</i>

301
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,441
<i>Okay, it's a fuck-up.
What are we gonna do now?</i>

302
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,523
<i>Here's the deal. A car broke down up ahead.</i>

303
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,847
<i>It's being sorted out,
but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.</i>

304
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,161
Get your service weapon out.

305
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,884
Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.

306
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,362
Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.

307
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,241
<i>Roger that.</i>

308
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,283
<i>Three lanes left. Seven o'clock. Green Civic.</i>

309
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,725
Bring your window down.

310
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,086
Gun.

311
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,924
Gun! Gun left!

312
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,127
<i>What are the rules here?</i>

313
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,169
<i>We must be engaged to engage.</i>

314
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,284
<i>Permission to get out of the vehicle
and set a perimeter?</i>

315
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,801
<i>Stay in your vehicle.</i>

316
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,043
<i>You can do what they do.
If they get out, you get out.</i>

317
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,891
<i>Get ready. They can see our lane clearing.</i>

318
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,405
<i>If it's coming, it's coming now.</i>

319
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,281
<i>Move!</i>

320
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,441
Wait, wait, wait!

321
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,521
Get outta the car.

322
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,446
Jesus Christ!

323
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,881
Don't move!

324
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,167
No,no,no,no!

325
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,931
What the fuck are we doing?

326
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,521
Fuck!

327
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,251
Lane's clear! The lane's clear!

328
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,447
Don't look at me!

329
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,281
Put your hands behind your head! Go!
Hands behind your head!

330
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,845
- All clear!
- I got this!

331
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,770
Go, go, go!

332
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,490
Move, move, move!

333
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,129
<i>This is gonna be on the front page
of every newspaper in America.</i>

334
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,563
No, it won't.
It won't even make the papers in El Paso.

335
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,041
Clear!

336
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,371
Got a little nutty, huh?

337
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,364
Nutty? Yeah, that was fucking illegal.

338
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,291
You wanna start a war?
You're a fucking spook!

339
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,841
And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?

340
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,201
Told you, you could stay here.

341
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,329
Jesus Christ. You just spray bullets at...

342
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,448
Yeah, sure, there's just
fucking civilians everywhere.

343
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,363
I'm not a soldier! This is not what I do!

344
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,171
Whoa! Don't sell yourself short, all right?

345
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,130
The reason Reggie's home is
I know he wasn't ready for this.

346
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,841
But he better get ready real quick
because this is the future, Kate!

347
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,446
Juérez is what happens when they dig in.
This is it!

348
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,521
What am I doing here?

349
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,807
What you're doing here is
you're giving us the opportunity

350
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,804
to shake the tree and create chaos.
That's what this is!

351
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,963
In the meantime,
just sponge everything up you see.

352
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,048
Learn! That's why you're here.

353
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,924
Guillermo...

354
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,131
You're giving him a belly full of water,
you devil.

355
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,362
You didn't think we'd get you here, did you?

356
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,880
<i>No hablo lnglés.</i>

357
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,610
<i>No hablo lnglés?</i>

358
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,846
<i>I love it</i> when <i>they no hablo Inglés.</i>

359
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,171
You know, I brought an old buddy of yours.

360
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,648
I bet you <i>hablo</i> to him. Yeah.

361
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,481
I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.

362
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,811
I know someone kept him alive for us.

363
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,369
I doubt it was easy.

364
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,605
What's easy these days?

365
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,848
I'm sorry about
what happened on the return.

366
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,644
I control only what I can.

367
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,646
It's not your fault.

368
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,204
There's rumors of a tunnel.

369
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,406
Fausto's main road into Arizona.

370
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,801
If you're doing what I think you're doing,
that's the best place to cross.

371
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,168
If you can find it. But time is against you.

372
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,166
In three days,
nobody will be where they are today.

373
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,801
Shall we?

374
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,010
No, it's better if you don't.
Something happens in that room,

375
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,124
it's easier to say you didn't see anything.

376
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,600
Well, Alejandro, I think he remembers you.

377
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,810
I'm gonna step out.

378
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,161
Timmy.

379
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,208
What do you keep lookin' at me for?

380
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,009
<i>No hablo lnglés, remember'?</i>

381
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,201
No, no.

382
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,084
Can I have one of those?

383
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,080
Thank you.

384
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,930
- You like fireworks?
- Huh?

385
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,085
Wanna see something cool?

386
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,721
Come on.

387
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,927
Here we go.

388
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,771
Look right there.

389
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,045
Unbelievable.

390
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,050
That's what happens when
you chop the head off a chicken.

391
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,121
Yeah.

392
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,690
I can see.

393
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,843
Can you get 'em all in one place?

394
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,131
We just landed back in Phoenix.
I'm on the clock, I can't wait.

395
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,169
All right, look, contact Bob Fisks.
Have him hold 'em in the staging area.

396
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,720
How long does it take to get to Tucson?

397
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,290
From here, it's a little over two hours.

398
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,284
All right. We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.

399
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,885
Are we going to Tucson?

400
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,167
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to sleep on a plane.

401
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,971
They let me on the base
when you need a ride, don't they?

402
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,087
You Okay?

403
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,685
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

404
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,091
And yet I answered.

405
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,801
Kate,

406
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,521
who's that?

407
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,005
<i>We' re gem' to Tucson.</i>

408
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,806
What's the deal, Matt?
Why you holdin' up my transport?

409
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,206
Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.

410
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,729
How's the auditor gonna react to
an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?

411
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,644
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
This is Kate Macer with the FBI.

412
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,324
This is her partner, what's-his-name.
It was her call.

413
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,364
It wasn't my call.
Have you got another one of those?

414
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,409
Finish it before you get up there.

415
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,481
No problem.

416
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,681
Hey, Kate.

417
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,768
Tell me what happened in El Paso.

418
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,368
We weren't in El Paso. We were in Mexico.

419
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,642
I guess we're not following any procedures.

420
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,001
What do you wanna do?

421
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,163
We want to talk to the people
caught around the Nogales area.

422
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,649
Okay. That group.

423
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,010
This group here. And that group.

424
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,046
Okay. They stay and the rest can go.

425
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,561
<i>Jose“</i>

426
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,686
<i>On the bus. Andale.</i>

427
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,523
What are we looking for?

428
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,365
Just keep watching.

429
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,929
- In Arizona.
- Arizona?

430
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,723
- Arizona.
- Arizona...

431
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,291
Talk to me. What are we doing?

432
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,885
I don't have any answers for you.

433
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,405
Let's get some, then.

434
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,050
Do you think
I haven't asked these questions?

435
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,121
Do you think you can do better?

436
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,201
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

437
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,089
Matt, can we talk for a minute?

438
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,201
What's up?

439
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,846
Everything okay?

440
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,125
You look very serious.

441
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,604
There's "in the dark"
and there's the way you're treating us.

442
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,762
I want to know the objective or I walk,
peﬂod.

443
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,803
Then go.
I didn't ask you to be here. She did.

444
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,485
I walk, too.

445
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,201
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

446
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,691
Fuckin' lawyers.

447
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,327
All right.

448
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,281
Guillermo

449
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,488
told us about a tunnel east of Nogales,
near Sasabe.

450
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,767
Now we're tryin' to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid,

451
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,410
so we can find the tunnel.

452
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,721
That better?

453
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,801
And Guillermo is...

454
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,882
Guillermo, he just told you
where the drug tunnel is?

455
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,007
He just told you?

456
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,764
Guillermo didn't have any other options.

457
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,922
We send him back across the border,
he's a dead man.

458
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,049
Now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an American prison,

459
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,606
in relative safety.

460
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,250
Just tell us the truth, man.

461
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,365
We are gonna make enough noise

462
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,408
that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico
to see his boss.

463
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,526
That's the truth.

464
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,761
And then?

465
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,408
And then we know where his boss is.

466
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,367
His name is Fausto Alarcon e! verdugo-.

467
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,130
Every day across that border,

468
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,048
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing.

469
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,804
To find him would be like
discovering a vaccine.

470
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,729
You understand the value of that.

471
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,082
All right, we're good.
Just don't keep us in the dark.

472
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,521
Great!

473
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,050
You afraid of the dark?

474
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,727
Hey!

475
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,568
It's been a humdinger of a day.
Go home. Get some rest.

476
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,604
We'll find our own ride.
We'll see you tomorrow!

477
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,883
I just drove a hundred fucking miles.

478
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,849
It's a fucking blessing, trust me.

479
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,001
Got you smokin' again?

480
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,081
Yeah.

481
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,563
Who the fuck's Guillermo?

482
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,888
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

483
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,570
The list of things I need.

484
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,683
I'm just saying. Some nice lacy somethin'.

485
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,808
It's been a while since someone's
seen me in a bra, except you.

486
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,011
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
I don't want your pity.

487
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,282
How was seeing Evan the other day?

488
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,366
I don't know...

489
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,283
- Miss him?
- Ask me something else.

490
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,925
I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq.
Gotta be careful around these people.

491
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,401
CIA's not supposed to
work this side of the fence.

492
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,045
He's a DOD advisor.

493
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,690
You really believe that?

494
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,771
You need somebody watching your six,
'cause I promise you they aren't.

495
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,604
You know,

496
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,288
we're not even scratching the surface
doing what we're doing.

497
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,361
And they are.

498
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,484
Well, you sure
picked the motherfuckers to show us.

499
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,845
What's the password?

500
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,206
Moron.

501
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,206
This is our spot.

502
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,088
No way! No, no.

503
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,165
Are you getting this?

504
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,845
That's our way across.

505
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,681
So, Guillermo was tellin' the truth?

506
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,844
It's gonna be a good day.

507
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,484
Hey, Kate.
Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?

508
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,284
Yeah, we use them in breaches all the time.

509
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,771
Good, 'cause we're gonna need their help.

510
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,887
What for?

511
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,123
We are gonna fuck with
Manuel Diaz's wallet.

512
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,083
This is our Smurf, guys.
Blonde hair, white purse.

513
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,448
- You know the Heimlich?
- Oh, yeah.

514
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,410
She tries to eat that deposit receipt,
you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?

515
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,481
Copy that.

516
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,009
There she goes. All right, go get 'em, tiger.

517
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,281
Take 'em.

518
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,890
<i>Hold Still! Hold Still!</i>

519
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,006
You want bank computers for evidence?

520
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,602
No, no. Just the money.
But freeze all his accounts, everything.

521
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,047
Even if his dog opened an account,
I want you to freeze it.

522
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,331
Who you got?

523
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,203
Got a mobile money launderer.

524
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,041
Pack it up.

525
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,889
Come on. Come on.

526
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,566
You coming?

527
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,687
No, don't go in the bank.

528
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,728
This is something
we can actually build a case on.

529
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,609
Don't go in the bank, Kate!

530
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,409
<i>There you go, and she's gem' "m the bank.</i>

531
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,489
These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?

532
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,928
Yeah. Cash deposits made daily
in $9,000 increments.

533
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,282
- So, it doesn't have to be reported.
- That's right.

534
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,646
And you can seize that?

535
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,008
I already have. And I'll go through
these wire transfer numbers and

536
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,048
freeze all these accounts as well.

537
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,161
Here you go.

538
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,890
- Damn, that's smart.
- What?

539
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,689
This is a bank line of credit.

540
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,006
See, you make payments
over what you owe,

541
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,765
and it doesn't show up as cash,
it shows up as a negative loan balance.

542
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,689
It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA...
This money is invisible.

543
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,165
How much does he have?

544
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,406
Take a look.

545
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,051
Oh, my God.

546
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,844
They just seized $17 million.

547
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,604
- It's a bogus bust, Kate.
- What?

548
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,684
You can't prosecute it. No one controls
who deposits money in an account.

549
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,364
An attorney will have that money back
in a few months,

550
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,971
but a lot of heads will roll before that.

551
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,401
But we can arrest Manuel for now.
We can get him off the street.

552
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,609
We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico.
That's the objective...

553
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,364
We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.

554
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,047
We have nothing.
We need to do something now.

555
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,451
Can't arrest him.

556
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,291
What?

557
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,601
When?

558
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,605
Wait a minute.

559
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,890
$9,000 is deposited into this account
every day in cash,

560
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,121
for five years.

561
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,285
That's not illegal.
It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.

562
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,209
I think the IRS might think it's illegal.

563
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,289
What do you want, Kate?
What would you like done here?

564
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,806
I want to follow
some semblance of procedure.

565
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,042
That's what I want.
To build a prosecutable case.

566
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,528
We prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year

567
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,206
than in the two previous years combined.

568
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,641
Are you feeling that on the street?

569
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,442
You getting the vibe that we're winning?

570
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,324
No.

571
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,402
Do you?

572
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,720
No sir, I don't.

573
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,130
Advisors like Matt come in,
they stir the pot,

574
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,851
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes.

575
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,407
That's how we build cases
against the individuals

576
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,562
that actually make a difference in this fight.

577
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,890
It's when they're nervous,
when they stop trusting their crews,

578
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,928
when they move their money.

579
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,889
These are all opportunities to strike.

580
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,121
And that's the purpose of people like Matt.

581
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,244
Kate, this isn't something
that I dreamed up myself.

582
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,963
I don't have the authority to hire advisors,

583
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,691
or authorize joint agency missions,

584
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,001
or fly agents from Air Force bases.

585
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,522
Are you understanding me?

586
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,683
These decisions are made far from here

587
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,801
by officials elected to office,
not appointed to them.

588
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,964
So, if your fear is operating out of bounds,

589
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,930
I am telling you, you are not.

590
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,643
The boundary's been moved.

591
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,726
Are we clear?

592
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,247
Yes, sir.

593
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,490
I need a fucking drink.

594
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,767
- Where do you wanna go?
- Anywhere.

595
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,166
I'm gonna go get a table.

596
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,924
- I guess it's on me.
- Thanks.

597
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,288
- What'll it be?
- Two beers.

598
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,721
Thank you.

599
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,642
I want a cigarette so bad.

600
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,961
Mace r?

601
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,970
Yeah?

602
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,208
I hate to go on about this,

603
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,686
but I think the bra situation's
the least of your problems.

604
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,807
Okay...

605
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,763
'Cause you look like shit.

606
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,929
You do. You look like shit.
Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.

607
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,407
They're like, "Kate used to be
a number one draft pick.

608
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,244
"Now look at her.
She looks like fuckin' shit."

609
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,369
Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.

610
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,601
No, they're not!

611
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,160
They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts.
You're losing weight...

612
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,287
I'm eating.

613
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,601
Look at you. What is it, one T-shirt a week?

614
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,126
At least work
on your personal hygiene, huh?

615
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,247
You sound like my mother.

616
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,725
Maybe I am your mother.

617
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,763
First we work on personal hygiene,
then we move on to the shopping.

618
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,571
Get you some potatoes, yeah?
Eat some food...

619
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,642
Where have you taken me?
What is this place?

620
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,966
It's a bar.

621
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,286
It's full 0' cowboys.

622
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,847
I'm a cowboy.

623
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,241
You're a redneck.

624
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,927
I'm a redneck. Got a trailer. Got a wife.

625
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,161
What are you talking about?

626
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,924
I got a trailer, I got a wife. She's my sister.

627
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,961
Hey, R99-

628
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,169
- Ted!
- What's goin' on?

629
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,203
- Long time. How you been?
- Yeah, it's good to see you, man.

630
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,441
Good to see you, too. How you been?

631
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,681
Gettin' your groove on, huh?

632
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,285
We're just startin'. We just got here.

633
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,364
All right. You gonna introduce me, man?

634
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,523
Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.

635
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,846
How you doin'? Just Ted, it's fine.

636
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,042
I saw you play softball once.

637
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,167
Softball?

638
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,969
She was at the game, Ted.

639
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,405
<i>“The game?“</i>

640
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,762
Where you struck out in slow-pitch softball.

641
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,610
You played really, really well.

642
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,847
I appreciate that.

643
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,681
I'm gonna head back to that bar now.
Can I get y'all another round?

644
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,166
Yeah, sure.

645
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,407
All right.

646
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,925
Ted, he's a good guy.

647
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,967
Divorced.

648
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,651
Just give me one second,
I'll be right with you.

649
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,326
All right...

650
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,245
Just wait, wait a second...

651
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,243
What, what? Is it too much?

652
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,249
Just wait one minute.
I just need a second.

653
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,488
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

654
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,406
Hey, Kate?

655
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,041
Hey! Hey, come here, stop, stop, talk to me.

656
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,370
Just talk to me. Okay?
Relax. Okay? Just take it...

657
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,130
Whoa, shit! Kate...

658
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,124
What is it? What? Stop.

659
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,209
Stop. Stop.

660
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,404
Shit, What the fuck! What did you...

661
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,923
- Don't...
- What the fuck are you...

662
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,561
God damn!

663
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,767
You fuckin' try to shoot me?
You fuckin' crazy?

664
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,804
- Stop that!
- Get off me!

665
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,367
Fuck that...

666
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,243
Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!

667
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,721
Stop!

668
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,568
Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!

669
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,723
Fuckin' stop!

670
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,643
Stop.

671
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,681
Fuck!

672
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,845
This is you, you hear me? You did this.
You did this.

673
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,165
You used me as bait.

674
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,808
Nah, you used yourself as bait.

675
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,245
I told you not to go in the bank.

676
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,445
You brought him back here, though.
That was smart.

677
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,371
Yeah. Love how
we're gonna pretend like I planned this.

678
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,040
Why don't you just write that in your report.

679
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,603
Come on! This is good news!

680
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,843
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.

681
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,725
Isn't that the point?

682
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,410
It's okay, Reg.

683
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,206
I thought he was a friend.

684
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,281
I know.

685
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,171
- Want me to stay tonight?
- No. I'm good.

686
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,766
- You sure?
- I'm good.

687
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,245
How y'all want me to talk to you
when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?

688
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,204
How many other corrupt motherfuckers are
you workin' with on this side of the border?

689
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,487
All right. Look...

690
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,685
It's exactly what I told you, all right?

691
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,643
They came to me
and they wanted details about our case,

692
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,167
and yes, I did it, I gave it to them,
but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.

693
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,044
I would have never gotten involved
with them pieces of shit

694
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,121
if I thought that there was any...

695
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,848
Fuck! Okay! Fuck! Okay!

696
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,602
"Okay, okay, okay,"
is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.

697
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,564
You know what the beauty is
of you being so beat to a pulp?

698
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,287
'Cause no one's gonna notice
a few more scratches.

699
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,210
This is a new deal, Ted.

700
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,641
I'm the one who decides whether
your daughter'll get Federal protection,

701
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,761
Fuck“.

702
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,963
Or whether we post
your ex-wife's address on the Internet.

703
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,287
I decide whether you go to prison
in a work camp in Missouri,

704
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,045
or a kill house like Corcoran.

705
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,201
All right.

706
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,765
This is where you negotiate
how to survive, my friend.

707
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,847
Okay. Look...

708
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,886
I feel like this whole thing's
just gotten away from me...

709
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,402
I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up
and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.

710
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,441
I'm sorry...

711
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,330
Fuck it! Get it out! Get it the fuck out!

712
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,681
Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!

713
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,281
Motherfucker! And fuck you!

714
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,841
Fuck!

715
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,131
How many officers
do they have working on the force?

716
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,169
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

717
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,489
You just gotta promise me that
my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?

718
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,763
You make me that promise.

719
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,525
You want the truth?

720
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,046
Please.

721
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,091
Give me all the names

722
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,885
of all the motherfuckers
they got working on the force.

723
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,411
Okay, okay...

724
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,000
- All right?
- Okay...

725
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,728
Okay. So, which phone do we start with?

726
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,371
It's in that one. That shitty one.

727
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,482
- That's the shitty one?
- Yes, sir!

728
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,120
How you feelin'?

729
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,365
Better.

730
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:53,642
Well, you should've shot him.

731
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,961
I just tried to have sex with my hitman.

732
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,161
Nah. He's no assassin.

733
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,566
He just wanted to know what you know.

734
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,166
They're after us, not you.

735
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,401
Thank you.

736
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,887
You remind me
of someone very special to me.

737
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,966
Get some rest.

738
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,240
Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz
back to Mexico,

739
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,090
and we'll cut a leg from them.

740
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,647
<i>Hello, sixty.</i>

741
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,605
<i>We have eyes on the objective.
Can we get a closer visual?</i>

742
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,806
<i>Ten meters going by the eastern ridge.</i>

743
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,047
Papa?

744
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,005
- Football?
- Si, Papa.

745
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,687
No!

746
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,161
Come on in.

747
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,446
Tasty beverage?

748
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,927
Okay, boys.

749
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,241
What's going on? What's the plan?

750
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,771
We're going hunting.

751
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,650
Looks like Manuel Diaz
is being called back to Mexico.

752
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,449
Just waiting for confirmation.

753
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,171
There's the tunnel right there.

754
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,241
All right, listen up.

755
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,485
Let's clarify the op.

756
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,810
We're gonna drive to location,
proceed on foot...

757
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,564
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

758
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,683
- I'm fine.
- How's the neck?

759
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,160
It's better, thank you.

760
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,925
Good, good.

761
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,851
These diagrams are based on
other tunnels that have been mapped.

762
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,724
They're for reference only,
they're not accurate.

763
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,046
Once on the Mexican side of the border,
there'll be a small staging area,

764
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,288
then another shaft
will lead to the main warehouse

765
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,044
and the road that returns to Mexico.

766
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,003
Once we clear the mules,
we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.

767
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,165
No, they use Mexican police
for vehicle transport.

768
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,084
If you see a uniform in the tunnel,
consider him a bandit, too.

769
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,962
Okay. You want to discuss ROE?

770
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,971
Nah, we'll save that for later.

771
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,041
Okay.

772
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,850
This is an in and out.
We're clearing, placing an agent.

773
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,085
It's all about creating a diversion.

774
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,482
Want the mother of all diversions, boys.

775
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,643
Need a lot of noise.
Fourth of July on steroids.

776
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,683
All right. Weapons check. Let's go, boys.

777
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,049
This looks like confirmation.

778
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,641
- I need to fit your guy with a locator.
- Yeah, do it.

779
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,961
Those are Special Ops.
Are we going in on this?

780
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,644
Nah. You guys aren't really dressed for it.

781
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,801
You didn't fuckin' tell us.

782
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,848
Yeah, well, you two went
cryin' to Daddy yesterday, and we

783
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,888
-don't want Daddy to know everything.
- Give me a fucking break!

784
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,200
All right, we'll get you some extra gear.

785
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,685
We have tac gear in the car.

786
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,240
All right. Good. You guys will hang back
when we get there, okay?

787
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,321
Then why are we going?

788
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,201
'Cause CIA
can't operate within US borders

789
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,601
without a domestic agency attached.

790
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,685
I told you you'd be useful.

791
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,363
So, that's it. That's why I'm here.

792
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,964
Yeah, that's it.

793
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,051
That's why you're here.

794
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,971
Hey, we find any drugs,
you guys get to confiscate 'em.

795
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,730
It's gonna be a big day.

796
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,125
Un-fuckin' real!

797
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,401
Front and back.

798
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,530
Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man.
They've been using us from the beginning.

799
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,761
We don't have to do this.

800
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,205
I need to know what they used us for.

801
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,203
- Doesn't matter what!
- Yes, it does!

802
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,761
I say we walk and make them
eat this whole fucked-up operation.

803
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,161
No. I have to know.

804
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,808
<i>Black Mercedes... Plate number:
Romeo-India-November-</i>

805
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,090
<i>three-one-Bravo-seven.
Heading south by southeast.</i>

806
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,921
<i>Where?</i>

807
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,686
Okay.

808
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,921
We gotta hit the tunnel
the minute we get on the ground.

809
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,926
Pretty exciting, huh?

810
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,165
What is the target's location?

811
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,847
<i>14 miles south of Nogales
heading west rapidly.</i>

812
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,889
Keep your fuckin' safeties on,
barrels pointed down.

813
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,881
Stay in the back.

814
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,530
Don't shoot anyone
on my fuckin' team. Right?

815
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,925
Gear check?

816
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,329
Thermal camera check.

817
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,970
Night vision goggles check.

818
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,610
Get those guys.

819
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,091
Wanna take Alpha squad, I'll take B squad?

820
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,169
- You got it. Let's do it.
- Let's go, boys.

821
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,522
Control, do you copy?

822
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,044
<i>Roger, Alpha. We read.</i>

823
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,850
<i>Fifty meters. Your three o'clock, Alpha.</i>

824
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,440
<i>Stand by. Getting close to objective.</i>

825
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,646
<i>Alpha, Bravo, be advised.
12 meters straight ahead.</i>

826
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,325
All right, we need to boogie and
we need to do it quiet till we find the center.

827
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,921
Draw the fighters to you
and make some noise.

828
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,048
Don't follow me. I'll be fine.

829
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,967
What are the rules of engagement?

830
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,723
Weapons free, my friend. Weapons free.

831
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,127
Weapons free, boys.

832
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,921
Good luck.

833
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,241
Oh, God!

834
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,251
"YOU okay?
'MY gun!

835
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,409
Leave it. Stay on my six.

836
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,921
Freeze!

837
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,530
Step away from him.

838
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,761
Put that down.

839
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,729
I mean it! Move away from him right now!

840
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,922
Don't ever point a weapon at me again.

841
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,521
Catch your breath. Then get back up there.

842
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,810
I am through. Do you have my location?

843
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,608
<i>Roger, we have you.
Target is east and north of you.</i>

844
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,529
<i>Looks like Highway 56 to 17.
Will intercept him if he stays on 17.</i>

845
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,962
<i>Go east on 56 off Highway 2.</i>

846
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,647
Wilco.

847
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,924
Is he through yet?

848
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,721
<i>We have joy. GPS is transmitting.
Audio is transmitting.</i>

849
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,604
<i>Should intercept in 20.</i>

850
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,850
That was a clean, clean fucking op,
my friend.

851
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,684
Except for these two assholes.

852
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,447
Well, you're better overseas.
You don't have to babysit.

853
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,601
Where's Kate?

854
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,520
I thought she was with you.

855
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,921
We gotta go back.

856
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,205
Shit. Boys, we're missin' one. Let's go.

857
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,721
Hey!

858
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,526
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

859
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,451
Stop! Stop!

860
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,565
Get off me!

861
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,290
Stop moving! Stop!

862
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,041
Stop it.

863
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:06,441
Just relax. Just relax.

864
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,802
All right? You gonna stay there?

865
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,564
Are you gonna stay there?

866
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,007
All right.

867
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,246
Now, you listen.

868
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,088
You went up the wrong tunnel.

869
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,241
You saw things you shouldn't have seen.

870
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,285
What is Medellin?

871
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,481
Medellin?

872
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,488
Medellin refers to a time

873
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,283
when one group controlled
every aspect of the drug trade,

874
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,725
providing a measure of order
that we could control.

875
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,567
And until somebody finds a way
to convince 20% of the population

876
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,121
to stop snorting and smoking that shit,

877
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,643
order's the best we can hope for.

878
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,882
And what you saw up there,

879
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,009
was Alejandro working toward
returning that order.

880
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,647
Alejandro works for
the fucking Colombian Cartel.

881
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,563
He works for the competition.

882
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,366
Alejandro works for anyone

883
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,040
who will point him toward
the people who made him.

884
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,603
Us.

885
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,681
Them.

886
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,003
Anyone who will turn him loose.

887
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,568
So, he can get the person
that cut off his wife's head,

888
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,051
and threw his daughter into a vat of acid.

889
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,201
Yeah.

890
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,842
That's what we're dealing with.

891
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,089
You can't do this.

892
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,806
You can't.

893
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:35,130
I'm sure as shit not the person
you're gonna hide it all behind.

894
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,440
You need to just take a breath.

895
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,960
I'm gonna fuckin' talk.

896
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,964
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

897
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,327
I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.

898
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,489
That would be a major mistake.

899
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,481
Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.

900
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,845
<i>Roger that.
Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.</i>

901
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,401
Silvio...

902
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,491
This motherfucker...

903
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,486
What happens when we get to the house?

904
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,801
You'll stop the car, I'll get out.

905
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,690
What will happen to me?

906
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,441
Slow it down.

907
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,921
<i>Six remain.</i>

908
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,165
<i>We're going blind.</i>

909
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,361
No.

910
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,931
Every night you have families killed.

911
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:03,604
And yet, here you dine.

912
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,282
Tonight should be no different.

913
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,001
Do you think the people that sent you here

914
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,681
are any different?

915
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,681
Who do you think we learned it from?

916
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,365
The grieving lawyer...

917
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:01,603
Your wife, you think she'd be proud
of what you've become?

918
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,363
Don't forget about my daughter.

919
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,651
Not in front of my boys.

920
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,210
Go ahead and finish your meal.

921
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,768
I would recommend not standing
on balconies for a while, Kate.

922
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,126
Sit down.

923
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,640
You look like a little girl when you're scared.

924
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,890
You remind me of the daughter
they took away from me.

925
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,366
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

926
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,764
It basically says that everything we did

927
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,405
was done by the book.

928
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,485
I can't sign that.

929
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,001
Sign it.

930
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,809
It's okay.

931
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,810
I can't sign that.

932
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,601
God!

933
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,440
You would be committing suicide, Kate.

934
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,722
Come on. Sign it.

935
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,923
You should move to a small town,

936
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:36,003
where the rule of law still exists.

937
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,049
You will not survive here.

938
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,690
You are not a wolf.

939
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,409
And this is the land of wolves now.
